## App Links

- **Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestoodio.naughtymath)**
- **Coming soon on the App Store**

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shukerullah/react-native-naughty-math.git
cd react-native-naughty-math
```

## Step 2: Install node modules

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

> **Note**: The steps provided are for Android only. iOS setup steps will be added later once the app is published to the App Store.

### Setting Up AdMob

1. **Create a Google AdMob Account:**
   - Sign up for an account at [Google AdMob](https://apps.admob.com/).

2. **Add Your App:**
   - In the AdMob dashboard, navigate to the "Apps" section.
   - Add a new app or select an existing app for the Android platform.
   - Note the unique app ID for your Android app.

3. **Update `app.json` with App ID:**
   - Open the `app.json` file located at the root of your React Native project.
   - Add the `android_app_id` key with the ID obtained from the AdMob console:

   ```json
   // <project-root>/app.json
   {
     "react-native-google-mobile-ads": {
       "android_app_id": "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxx~xxxxxxxx"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Set Interstitial and Banner Ad Unit IDs:**
   - Open the `./src/libs/Admob/index.tsx` file.
   - Add your Interstitial and Banner Ad Unit IDs obtained from the AdMob console:

   ```typescript
   // <project-root>/src/libs/Admob/index.tsx
   export const HOME_BANNER_UNIT_ID = "your_banner_unit_1_id";
   export const GAME_PLAY_BANNER_UNIT_ID = "your_banner_unit_2_id";
   export const GAME_PLAY_INTERSTITIAL_UNIT_ID = "your_interstitial_id";
   ```

### Setting Up Firebase Analytics

1. **Obtain `google-services.json`:**
   - Generate the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project settings.
   - For detailed instructions on setting up Firebase Analytics with React Native, refer to the [React Native Firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#2-react-native-cli---android-setup).

2. **Place the `google-services.json` File:**
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in your project at the following location:
     ```plaintext
     /android/app/google-services.json
     ```

3. **Uncomment Firebase Analytics Code:**
   - Once you have successfully added `google-services.json`, uncomment the following lines in `./src/libs/Analytics/index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   // <project-root>/src/libs/Analytics/index.tsx
   ...
   // line#42
   analytics().logEvent(name, params, options);

   ...
   // line#69
   analytics().logScreenView(params);
   ```

### Setting Up OneSignal

1. **Create a OneSignal Account:**
   - Go to [OneSignal](https://www.onesignal.com) and sign up for an account.

2. **Create a New Application:**
   - After logging in, create a new application in the OneSignal Dashboard.
   - Note down the `App ID` provided for the application.

3. **Configure OneSignal in Your Project:**
   - Open your project directory and navigate to `./src/libs/OneSignal/index.tsx`.
   - Paste the copied `App ID` into the file as shown below:

   ```typescript
   // <project-root>/src/libs/OneSignal/index.tsx
   export const ONESIGNAL_APP_ID = "your-app-id-here";
   ```

4. **Set Up Android Firebase Credentials:** (Same as Step: 1 in Setting Up Firebase Analytics)
   - Ensure that you've followed this guide to set up your [Android Firebase Credentials](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-firebase-credentials).
   - Generate the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project.
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `./android/app/` directory of your project:

   ```plaintext
   /android/app/google-services.json
   ```

### Setting Up Google Play Games Leaderboard & Achievements

1. **Configure Your Game in the Google Play Developer Console:**
   - Navigate to the [Google Play Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling).
   - Follow the steps to add a new game and obtain your app ID.

2. **Link Your App:**
   - Ensure your app is correctly linked in the Google Play Console. Missing this step will cause the library to fail silently.

3. **Create Leaderboards and Achievements:**
   - Create leaderboards and achievements in the Google Play Console.
   - Note down their IDs for use in your project.

4. **Update `GameServices` Configuration:**
   - Open the `./src/libs/GameServices/index.ts` file.
   - Add your leaderboard ID and achievement IDs:

   ```typescript
   // <project-root>/src/libs/GameServices/index.ts
   const LEADERBOARD_ID = 'your_leaderboard_id';

   const achievementIds = [
     'achievement_1',
     'achievement_2',
     'achievement_3',
     'achievement_4',
     'achievement_5',
     'achievement_6',
     'achievement_7',
     'achievement_8',
     'achievement_9',
     'achievement_10',
   ];

   // Scores required to unlock achievements
   const achievementRequiredScore = [1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200];
   ```

5. **Update `strings.xml`:**
   - Open the `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file.
   - Add your game services project ID:

   ```xml
   <resources>
       <string name="app_name">Naughty Math</string>
       <string translatable="false" name="game_services_project_id">{your_project_id}</string>
   </resources>
   ```

_Note: Achievements used in Naughty Math are placed within the ./assets/achievements directory._
